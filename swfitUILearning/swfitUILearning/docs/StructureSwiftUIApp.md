#  Structure of swiftUI app

```text

When you create a new SwiftUI app, you’ll get a selection of files and maybe 20 lines of code in total.

Inside Xcode you should see the following files in the space on the left, which is called the project navigator


```

- xxxApp.swift contains code for launching your app. If you create something when the app launches and keep it alive the entire time, you’ll put it here.
- ContentView.swift contains the initial user interface (UI) for your program, and is where we’ll be doing all the work in this project.
- Assets.xcassets is an asset catalog – a collection of pictures that you want to use in your app. You can also add colors here, along with app icons, iMessage stickers, and more.
- Preview Content is a group, with Preview Assets.xcassets inside – this is another asset catalog, this time specifically for example images you want to use when you’re designing your user interfaces, to give you an idea of how they might look when the program is running.
